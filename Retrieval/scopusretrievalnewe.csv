REDUCING LANDSAT DATA TO PARAMETERS WITH PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND SIGNATURE EXTENSION - A VIEW OF LANDSAT CAPABILITIES.,"['', '', '', '']",11,Journal,[],['LANDSAT DATA'],"The premise of this paper is that LANDSAT is capable of sensing only a few physical parameters; all computer processing and recognition schemes for LANDSAT data can be successful only to the extent that the desired classifications correlate with, or are designated by, these physical parameters. When this is not the case, automatic recognition results can become highly circumstantial and often hopelessly ambiguous. Although some limited differentiation of plant species can be done by computer processing, most often separation of vegetation types is less dependent on species differences than on differences caused by topography or content of vigorous vegetation. Much of the contrast provided in LANDSAT data is provided by differences in vegetation cover. Examples are discussed of physical relationships in the spectral configuration of the LANDSAT multispectral scanner. The paper suggests the importance of isolating and documenting these relationships so that enhancement, categorical analysis, and image interpretation can better be based upon criteria with physical significance, providing spatial and temporal extension.","The premise of this paper is that LANDSAT is capable of sensing only a few physical parameters; all computer processing and recognition schemes for LANDSAT data can be successful only to the extent that the desired classifications correlate with, or are designated by, these physical parameters.

The view angle effect, which is caused by differing view angles, could be studied by comparing data collected at different view angles over a fixed location at a fixed time. Since such LANDSAT data is not available, consecutive day acquisition data were used as a substitute. The study shows that there is approximately a 5% reduction in the average sensor response on the second-day acquisitions as compared with the first-day acquisitions, and that the view angle effect differs field to field and crop to crop. On false infrared color pictures the view angle effect causes changes primarily in brightness and to a lesser degree in color.","The LANDSAT multispectral scanner scans over a range of view angles of minus 5. 78 to 5. 78 degrees.

The classification results were evaluated first against historical data and again using a technique which involved sample plot checks. For the May data set, aggregating the county acreages into a single acreage per class resulted in acreages which varied less than 10 percent from the historical data.

The most important mineralogical differences are the increased abundance of goethite, hematite, and jarosite, and the presence of alunite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite in the altered rocks. Analysis of reflectance spectra recorded in the field showed that the altered rock spectra are characterized by broad absorption bands in the 0.45-0.50 μm and 0.85-0.95 μm regions which are due to electronic processes in the iron ions, and a band near 2.2 μm which is due to vibrational processes in the OH ions. These features are absent or weak in most of the unaltered rock spectra. Therefore, the shapes of the 0.45-2.4 μm spectra for these altered and unaltered rocks are conspicuously different. However, because of the wavelength positions and widths of the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) bands, these spectral differences are not apparent in individual or color-infrared composite MSS images. The technique developed to enhance these subtle spectral differences combines ratioing of the MSS bands and contrast stretching. The stretched ratio values are used to produce black-and-white images which depict materials according to spectral reflectance; ratioing minimizes the influence of topography and overall albedo on the grouping of spectrally similar materials. Color compositing of two or more stretched ratio images to form color-ratio composites provides additional enhancement. The most effective color-ratio composite for discriminating between the altered and unaltered areas, as well as among many of the unaltered rocks in south-central Nevada, was prepared using the following diazo color and stretched ratio image combinations: blue for MSS 4/5, yellow for MSS 5/6, and magenta for MSS 6/7. Altered areas appear green and brown in this combination. Field evaluation of this color-ratio composite shows that excluding alluvial areas, approximately 80 percent of the green and brown color patterns are related to hydrothermal alteration. The remaining 20 percent consists mainly of pink hematitic crystallized tuff, a result of vapor-phase crystallization, and of tan and red ferruginous shale and siltstone. Discrimination of this unaltered tuff from the altered rocks may be possible in the 2.2 μm region because this absorption band is absent in the tuff spectra.

Reproducibility of geological lineaments and other discrete features interpreted from imagery: measurement by a coefficient of association,"['60005750', 'CSIRO Minerals', 'Melbourne', 'Australia']",9,Journal,[],[],"A characteristic of discrete natural features annotated on aerial photographs or satellite imagery by a photointerpreter, is the lack of 100% reproducibility between different annotations of the same scene by different observers or by the same observer on different occasions. A measure of reproducibility, R, is defined and applied to geological lineaments, but can be extended to themes of any shape or connectivity, such as water masses, forest areas, soil types or urban themes. It is termed nongeometric since it differs from correlation coefficients based upon geometric lineament properties, such as length and trend. Reproducibility is defined as a quantified coefficient of association for the logical quantity, on-line, which is the number of times a given pixel is classified as being on a lineament. Reproducibility may be measured by digital techniques or by three analog techniques termed ""traverse"", ""length"", and ""areal"". Since different measurement techniques do not yield identical results, we label the reproducibility R1, R2, R3, and R4, respectively, in ordér to distinguish the measuring technique. Reproducibilities can be compared for a number of annotations provided line width, image scale, and measuring technique are held constant. Comparisons suggest that (i) for Skylab photography, reproducibility of density extrema (but not of density gradients), increases with resolution; (ii) for Landsat-1 imagery, reproducibility within spectral bands is higher than between bands; (iii) for imagery from different sources, the effect on reproducibility is larger for different sources than for different observers; (iv) reproducibility varies with spatial shift, with a peak at zero shift (that is, when annotations are registered), indicating the presence of a signal; and (v) fluctuations in reproducibility within a scene appear to be unrelated to image quality or rock type.

Les tâches de la science géographique dans les conditions actuelles de la révolution scientifique et technique,"['', '', '', '']",0,Journal,[],[],"I - Long-distance detection, or teledetection, is one of the most important of the new techniques of investigation for today's geographer. Not only has the number of recording devices increased (e.g., radiometers with scanners) but the number of vectors involved as well (the airplane and above all, the satellite). More than simply increasing the amount of our knowledge quantitatively, teledetection has led both to changes in our working methods and to the extension of the goals of geography. NASA's two Landsats, for example, gather great amounts of information (four figures are provided for each half hectare in a strip covering 185 km, the satellites circling the earth every 103 min and flying over every point of the globe every nine days). By using traditional taxonomic classifications, one can translate these data into specific definitions of each basic ground marking that is identified. Likewise, these data can finish up in the form of maps and regular statistical information on landscapes, though the numerical form in which this new source of investigation provides us with its information leads us quite naturally to use the computer sciences when taking up the question of classifications, and thereby to set up new taxonomic systems. Landscapes are then identified and regrouped automatically in processing, this inviting us to reflect seriously on the definitions of landscapes that are drawn up. The historical development of the many-faceted characteristics of landscapes can be grasped by using diachronic data. Nevertheless, in spite of the great advantage provided by the scientific and technical revolution's new means of teledetection-the renovation of our treatment of landscapes-these methods should not become ends in themselves, but should contribute to our constantly modified knowledge of the earth's surface. Computer technology makes it possible, with cathodic screens, to set up a dialogue between computers and those who use them, thereby freeing the geographer from the need to draw on a mass of data himself, and thus allowing him to devote his entire time to reflection and scientific thinking. II - Because scientific and technical advances have provided with more accurate knowledge of the natural environment, we can say that the role of physical geography has been enhanced. Physical geography, for some time now, has ceased to be a merely literary an of description, for as an explanatory science it has become a science in the true sense of the word, with its own methods of observation and analysis. What distinguishes geography from the other natural sciences, however, is its ability to join together a great number of disciplines, thus creating a state of mind naturally inclined to making synthesis. The effects of this can be seen as much in pure research as it can in applied research. Thus geomorphology, for example, by its study of surface formations, sets up the necessary link between geology and soil geography. These surface formations, moreover, and geomorphology, can be completely understood only by looking at them with the perspective of bioclimatology. Broadly speaking, geomorphology brings together these points of view. The notion of «crisiså, of a collapse of the natural equilibrium, has been making increasing headway in geography. Stability is not relative and cyclical patterns come from the endless reworkings in space and in time. An equilibrium is followed by its collapse and then by another equilibrium and its collapse, and so on successively, but the lack of continuity is more notable than the element of continuity. Research on thresholds is one of the common goals of all the natural sciences. III - Forty years ago, the treatment of the relationship between Nature and Society would have meant treating almost the entire corpus of geographical research. Twenty years later the role of geography in the analysis of these relationships and the solutions worked out had become distinctively blurred. The central role of geography, in touch with both the natural sciences and the human sciences, was called into question by the very advances it had made in research. If the use of new techniques in physical geography encouraged specialization (in geomorphology in particular), the development of the human sciences, themselves dealing with increasingly limited sectors, drew increasing attention to the impact on geography of social and economic phenomena. The relationships of Man and Nature were no longer the central concern of geographers. Tropical geography alone perhaps avoided this compartmentalization. For the past ten years, the development of geography has been marked by the increasing use of a synthetic approach to problems, and at the same time, by a renewed interest in the study of the relationships between Nature and Society. Here once again, the need for scientific accuracy has been intensified by changes in society. Ecology has been made fashionable by the crisis provoked in the natural environment by industrial growth, by urbanization and by the accelerated movement of people from the country, this leading to a rebirth of a geography of landscapes that opens new perspectives on to the rejoining of the two basic currents in geographical thought and research. This renewal of interest is particularly perceptible in physical geography. In biogeography, the desire for accuracy and what can be expressed quantitatively aims at apprehending that part of the biosphere that has a determinant role in the life of vegetation and in agriculture. The new terms of reference of the science of landscapes are geotope, geofacies, geosystem. But it is to social geography that one must go for explanations of homogeneous vegetative landscapes that seem to sprouted up spontaneously. The study of the way Man has shaped and worked Nature is, that is, the natural domain for showing the inter-relationships of physical and social geography. Even if the technics are different, what is essential is that their goals should be the same. At a time when the most highly developed societies are asking themselves where growth is to lead them, when the most highly specialized disciplines are discovering the virtues of making correlations, it is essential for geography to regain its sometimes incomfortable but necessary role as the link between the physical and human sciences and for it to continue analyzing the relationships between societies and the natural environment where they live. The study of the environment, the science of habitats and not only of the pollution to be found there, is a new direction of study in which geographers have a legitimate role to play. Though the actions of human groups can be orientated or influenced by the characteristics of the physical environment, Man's acqusittion of ever more efficient techniques helps to impose major and long-lasting transformations of Nature. In tomorrow's world, the data we currently dispose of on the environment and the way they progress will be the numerical measure of our progress: a mapping of the environment and its natural processes is necessary if we are to keep up with growth, at the same time as we decontaminate, protect and improve the environment so as to make those in charge of the rational organization of the land more sensitive to the course of growth, and lastly, so as better to use and administer the environment and natural resources. © 1976.","I - Long-distance detection, or teledetection, is one of the most important of the new techniques of investigation for today's geographer.
