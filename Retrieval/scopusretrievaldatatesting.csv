Analysis of Driving Force and Driving Mechanism of the Spatial Change of LST Based on Landsat 8,112573524,0,Journal,"['Geographic detector', 'Influence mechanism', 'LST', 'Quantitative analysis']",[],"© 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.Land surface temperature (LST) is considered as one of the most effective factors in urban ecology, which plays an important role in connecting urban surface energy. In urban regions, LST reveals lots of inconsistencies due to the effect of such factors as normalized difference built up index (NDBI), vegetation fraction (Pv), solar radiation, population, GDP and land use. The mono-window algorithm (MWA) was used to simulate the urban LST. We compared the results of mono-window algorithm (MWA) and radiative transfer equation (RTE), and used the MODIS LST data to verify the inversion results. The calculations showed a good correlation between MWA and RTE, and the comparison revealed that the results of MWA were also in good agreement with the MOD11A1 LST observations. At the same time, the influence of these factors on the spatial distribution of LST was also quantified by using geographic detector. The influence mechanism of these factors on the spatial distribution of LST through interaction. According to geographic detector, NDBI was the main influencing factor for the spatial distribution of urban LST, followed by vegetation fraction (Pv), land use, population density, GDP, and solar radiation. These factors showed mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement on the spatial distribution of LST.","© 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.Land surface temperature (LST) is considered as one of the most effective factors in urban ecology, which plays an important role in connecting urban surface energy.

"Forecasting seasonal plot-specific crop coefficient (Kc) protocol for processing tomato using remote sensing, meteorology, and artificial intelligence",123341506,0,Journal,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Crop coefficient', 'Irrigation scheduling', 'Kc protocols', 'Processing tomato']",[],"© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The crop coefficient (Kc) is a key parameter in irrigation scheduling decision-making and depends on local conditions, e.g., crop type, weather, and topography. Kc protocol or curve, and the derived growth stages, describe generally the expected behavior of the crop during the growing season and growers use it to different extents. However, Kc protocols are usually experimentally determined and hence spatially limited. This study shows an approach to generate an estimated plot-specific Kc protocol in a more cost-effective way that is not spatially limited. To that end, data for almost 600 commercial processing tomato plots were collected. The data included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, meteorological data, and plot properties such as country, and the season start date. Then, an artificial intelligence model was trained on the 2017–2019 growing seasons and validated for 2020. At the beginning of the season, the model estimated the crop behavior in terms of Kc for the entire season. Additionally, a piecewise regression model was employed to estimate the crop growth stages in terms of days from the season start. The results of this study show improvement in both Kc and growth stage estimation, compared to experimental Kc protocols. The results can help design the irrigation regime (when and how much irrigation is needed) at the plot level and thus improve the ability to allocate the required water amounts between plots in real-time and even to plan it before the season starts.","© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The crop coefficient (Kc) is a key parameter in irrigation scheduling decision-making and depends on local conditions, e.g., crop type, weather, and topography.

Evaluating the impact of land use and land cover change on unprotected wetland ecosystems in the arid-tropical areas of South Africa using the Landsat dataset and support vector machine,60031569,1,Journal,"['Drivers of wetland conversion', 'rural development', 'support vector machine', 'temporal change', 'wetland degradation']",[],"© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The study explored the impact of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change dynamics in relation to the condition and status of an unprotected wetland located in the arid-tropical parts of the Limpopo Province, South Africa. The long-term Landsat archival data series was used to map and quantify the impacts of LULC change on the wetland over a period of 36years (1983–2019). A multi-source satellite image analysis was performed, using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and advanced spatially- explicit geographic information system tools. Landsat data series covering the entire study area was used to assess, map and monitor LULC change that occurred over-time. Post-classification maps for the Maungani wetland area were analysed to provide a quantitative assessment and a detailed overview of the rate of change. The generated wetland detection maps for four temporal phases (i.e., 1983–1992, 1992–2001, 2002–2010) were analysed. This study found that the spatial extent of the wetland area declined severely during the period under study with 728 300ha. The findings of this work provide critical insights and baseline information about the state of unprotected wetlands in the rural parts. This information is useful for the development of tailor-made wetland management strategies and a possible rehabilitation framework for unprotected wetland ecosystems.","© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The study explored the impact of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change dynamics in relation to the condition and status of an unprotected wetland located in the arid-tropical parts of the Limpopo Province, South Africa.

Coupled forest zoning and agricultural intervention yields conflicting outcomes for tropical forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),60020304,0,Journal,"['Africa', 'agricultural intervention', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'forest conservation', 'forest monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'sustainable development']","['Africa', 'Agricultural intervention', 'Democratic republic of the congo', 'Food security', 'Forest conservation', 'Forest monitoring', 'Rebound-effect', 'Remote-sensing', 'Sustainable development', 'Tree cover']","© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Agricultural intensification and forest conservation are often seen as incompatible. Agricultural interventions can help boost food security for poor rural communities but in certain cases can exacerbate deforestation, known as the rebound effect. We tested whether coupling agricultural interventions with participatory forest zoning could improve food security and promote forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simple agricultural interventions led to a >60% increase in cassava yields and a spill-over effect of improved cassava variety uptake in non-intervention zones. Household surveys conducted at the end of the 8 year project implementation period revealed that households that received agricultural interventions had more favorable attitudes toward forest zoning and conservation. The surveys also showed that farmers in the intervention domain practiced less land-intensive field and fallow management strategies compared to those practiced in the non-intervention domain. However, an 18 year time series analysis of Landsat satellite data revealed that agricultural expansion persisted in areas both with and without intervention assistance, and there is risk of a rebound effect. Approximately 70% of the tree cover loss that occurred outside of the agricultural areas was located within a 3 km buffer zone surrounding the outermost edges of the agricultural areas, which suggested that the majority of tree cover loss was caused by agricultural expansion. Within that 3 km buffer, average annual tree cover loss during the post-intervention period was higher in the intervention domain compared to the non-intervention domain (0.17% yr-1 compared to 0.11% yr-1 respectively, p < 0.001), suggesting risk of a rebound effect. The disconnection between household perceptions of zoning adherence and actual behavior indicates the importance of strengthening governance structures for community-based monitoring and enforcement.

Lessons learned in developing reference data sets with the contribution of citizens: The Geo-Wiki experience,60019497,3,Journal,"['citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'environmental monitoring', 'land cover', 'reference data', 'remote sensing']","['Citizen science', 'Data collection', 'Data set', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'High quality', 'Land cover', 'Large amounts', 'Reference data', 'Remote sensing classification', 'Remote-sensing']","© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.The development of remotely sensed products such as land cover requires large amounts of high-quality reference data, needed to train remote sensing classification algorithms and for validation. However, due to the lack of sharing and the high costs associated with data collection, particularly ground-based information, the amount of reference data available has not kept up with the vast increase in the availability of satellite imagery, e.g. from Landsat, Sentinel and Planet satellites. To fill this gap, the Geo-Wiki platform for the crowdsourcing of reference data was developed, involving visual interpretation of satellite and aerial imagery. Here we provide an overview of the crowdsourcing campaigns that have been run using Geo-Wiki over the last decade, including the amount of data collected, the research questions driving the campaigns and the outputs produced such as new data layers (e.g. a global map of forest management), new global estimates of areas or percentages of land cover/land use (e.g. the amount of extra land available for biofuels) and reference data sets, all openly shared. We demonstrate that the amount of data collected and the scientific advances in the field of land cover and land use would not have been possible without the participation of citizens. A relatively conservative estimate reveals that citizens have contributed more than 5.3 years of the data collection efforts of one person over short, intensive campaigns run over the last decade.

We present a new method of mapping irrigation based on an ensemble of convolutional neural networks that use reflectance information from Landsat imagery to classify irrigated pixels. The methodology does not rely on extensive feature engineering and does not condition the classification with land-use information from existing geospatial datasets. The ensemble does not need exhaustive hyperparameter tuning, and the analysis pipeline is lightweight enough to be implemented on a personal computer. Furthermore, the proposed methodology provides an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the classification.

We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by mapping irrigation over the state of Montana from 2000 to 2019. We found that our method outperforms other methods that use satellite remote-sensing information in terms of overall accuracy (OA) and precision. We found that our method agrees better statewide with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Survey estimates of irrigated areas compared to other methods and has far fewer errors of commission in rainfed agriculture areas.

Time-series maps reveal widespread change in plant functional type cover across Arctic and boreal Alaska and Yukon,60006226,0,Journal,"['Alaska', 'Canada', 'Landsat', 'plant cover', 'plant functional type']","['Alaska', 'Boreal ecosystems', 'Canada', 'LANDSAT', 'Macrolichen', 'Plant functional type', 'Study areas', 'Times series', 'Vegetation change', 'Vegetation dynamics']","© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.Widespread changes in the distribution and abundance of plant functional types (PFTs) are occurring in Arctic and boreal ecosystems due to the intensification of disturbances, such as fire, and climate-driven vegetation dynamics, such as tundra shrub expansion. To understand how these changes affect boreal and tundra ecosystems, we need to first quantify change for multiple PFTs across recent years. While landscape patches are generally composed of a mixture of PFTs, most previous moderate resolution (30 m) remote sensing analyses have mapped vegetation distribution and change within land cover categories that are based on the dominant PFT; or else the continuous distribution of one or a few PFTs, but for a single point in time.

We improve on previous methods of detecting vegetation change by modeling TC, a continuous measure of plant abundance. The PFTs collectively include all vascular plants within the study area as well as light macrolichens, a nonvascular class of high importance to caribou management. We identified net increases in deciduous shrubs (66 × 103 km2), evergreen shrubs (20 × 103 km2), broadleaf trees (17 × 103 km2), and conifer trees (16 × 103 km2), and net decreases in graminoids (-40 × 103 km2) and light macrolichens (-13 × 103 km2) over the full map area, with similar patterns across Arctic, oroarctic, and boreal bioclimatic zones. Model performance was assessed using spatially blocked, nested five-fold cross-validation with overall root mean square errors ranging from 8.3% to 19.0%. Most net change occurred as succession or plant expansion within areas undisturbed by recent fire, though PFT TC change also clearly resulted from fire disturbance.
